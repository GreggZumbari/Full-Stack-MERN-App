# Full-Stack-MERN-App
A Full Stack MERN App that I made for my Web Development class at Oregon State University. Made by Greggory Hickman, 2022.
Do note that if you intend on using Node.js to run this app, you must first install node modules in both exercises-rest and exercises-ui. Also, note that much of the functionality of this app depends on the .env file in the exercises-rest folder (Full-Stack-MERN-App/exercises-rest/.env) being hooked up to a MongoDB database.
